
Hi,this is a small description of my code, 
the code has 4 fucntions, 2 of which are used to enhance images(equalization,matching)
the other two are for calculating and normalizing histograms.
to see how equalization works on images I equalized the histogram of girl.PNG using 
the following command:  python ./Histogram.py E girl.PNG -o girlEqualized.PNG 
and saved it in girlEqualized.PNG, you can see that the image looks much better and the details
got enhanced.
to see how matching looks like you can run the followwing command:
 python ./Histogram.py M darkflower.PNG lightflower.PNG -o matched.PNG
 in which I match the histogram of the dark flowers to the lighter one which creates a more enhanced 
 looking flower with distinciton that gets saved in matched.PNG.
