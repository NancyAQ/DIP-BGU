This repo includes all 4 assignments Ive worked on during the "Digital Image processing" course I took at bgu, these assignments are practical implementation of 
theoretical concepts we were taught which I enjoyed greatly.
Each assignment folder has a description file which describes what it does and how to run it alongside example runs.
All assignments were written in python with the use of opencv.
