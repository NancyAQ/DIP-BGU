
Hi there, this is a quick run through of what my code does,
the code mainly uses euclidean distance calculations to get accurate distance results as the python built
in function does too, using both forward and backward scans+ 8 adjacency calculation helps achieve accuracy
as well.
the file includes an example pic(example.jpg) and:
1- the output of the inner choice (inner.jpg)
2- the output of the outer choice (outer.jpg)
3- the output of the signed choice (signed.jpg)
you can get each by running the next command in the powershell:
python ./DistanceTransform.py example.jpg 15 type(I,O,S) type.jpg
overall runtime is O(mn).
